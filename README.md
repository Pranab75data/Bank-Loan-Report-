# Bank-Loan-Report-
This project analyzes a Bank Loan Dataset to generate insights related to loan applications, funded amounts, repayment amounts, and borrower risk.
The main objective is to evaluate loan performance and identify patterns between good loans (safe for the bank) and bad loans (risky for the bank).

# Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

1. Analyze Loan Applications

* Track total loan applications on a month-to-date (MTD) and month-over-month (MoM) basis.

2. Evaluate Loan Funding & Repayments

* Measure the total funded amount and total amount received to assess financial performance.

3. Monitor Borrower Risk Indicators

* Calculate the average interest rate and average debt-to-income (DTI) ratio to understand borrower risk levels.

4. Segment Loan Quality

* Categorize loans into Good Loans (performing) and Bad Loans (non-performing).

* Compare applications, funded amounts, and repayment trends for both segments.

5. Provide Business Insights for Decision-Making

* Help banks identify growth trends, minimize risk, and improve loan approval strategies

1. Loan Application Trends

Total Loan Applications (MTD, MoM) → Tracks month-to-date and month-over-month growth in applications.

2. Financial Metrics

Total Funded Amount (MTD, MoM) → Measures the amount of money disbursed by the bank.

Total Amount Received (MTD, MoM) → Tracks repayments collected by the bank.

3. Borrower Risk Indicators

Average Interest Rate (MTD, MoM) → Shows trends in lending interest rates.

Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio (MTD, MoM) → Indicates borrower affordability and repayment capacity.
